KRAS G12C Inhibitor Shows Promise in Phase 2 Trial

Published in Endpoints News - October 15, 2025

Amgen's KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib demonstrated a 45% objective response rate (95% CI: 35-55%) in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to data presented at ESMO 2025.

The Phase 2 trial enrolled 120 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC who had received at least one prior line of therapy. The primary endpoint was ORR as assessed by independent central review.

Key findings:
- ORR: 45% (n=54/120)
- Median duration of response: 10.8 months
- Median progression-free survival: 8.2 months
- Grade ≥3 adverse events: 65%
- Discontinuation due to AEs: 12%

"These results support the continued development of sotorasib in this difficult-to-treat patient population," said lead investigator Dr. Jane Smith from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

The company plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial comparing sotorasib to standard chemotherapy in 2L NSCLC patients with KRAS G12C mutations.
